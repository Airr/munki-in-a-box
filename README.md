Post Munki Install Simple Deployment Script


The goal of this script is to deploy a basic munki repo in a simple script based on a set of common variables. I have placed defaults in these variables, but they are easily overridden and you should decide where they go.

This script is based upon the Demonstration Setup Guide for Munki, AutoPKG, and other sources. My sincerest thanks to Greg Neagle, Tim Sutton, Allister Banks, Rich Trouton, Charles Edge and numerous others who have helped me assemble this script.
