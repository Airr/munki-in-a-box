I have placed defaults in these variables, but they are easily overridden and you should decide where they go.\r\n\r\nThis script is based upon the [Demonstration Setup Guide for Munki](https://code.google.com/p/munki/wiki/DemonstrationSetup), [Getting Started with AutoPKG](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki/Getting-Started), and other sources. My sincerest thanks to Greg Neagle, Tim Sutton, Allister Banks, Rich Trouton, Charles Edge and numerous others who have helped me assemble this script.\r\n\r\nPre-Requisites:\r\n\r\n1) 10.8/Server 2 or 10.9/Server 3  \r\n2) Web Services Enabled\r\n\r\nDirections for Use:\r\n\r\n1) Download Script  \r\n2) Alter Lines 19-20 to reflect your choice for munki repo name and location  \r\n3) Alter Line 82 to reflect your choice of AutoPKG installs  \r\n4) sudo ./munkiinabox.sh\r\n\r\nQuestions?
