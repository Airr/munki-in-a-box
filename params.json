I have placed defaults in these variables, but they are easily overridden and you should decide where they go.\r\n\r\nThis script is based upon the [Demonstration Setup Guide for Munki](https://code.google.com/p/munki/wiki/DemonstrationSetup), [Getting Started with AutoPKG](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki/Getting-Started), and other sources. My sincerest thanks to Greg Neagle, Tim Sutton, Allister Banks, Rich Trouton, Charles Edge and numerous others who have helped me assemble this script.\r\n\r\nQuestions? Comments? Suggestions? Jeers?
